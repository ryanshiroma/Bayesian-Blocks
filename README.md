# SJSU-CAMCOS-NASA-Bayesian-Blocks
SJSU CAMCOS NASA Bayesian Blocks research project
I'm currently working on a few projects:
1) Gamma Ray Burst Triggering using Bayesian Blocking
2) Optimal linear and exponential segmentation of GRB data using Bayesian Blocks
3) DNA segmentation with Binomial Bayesian Blocks
